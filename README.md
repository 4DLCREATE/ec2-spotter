# AWS Persistant Spot Intance
Forked from https://github.com/atramos/ec2-spotter

EC2 spot instances behave much like regular instances, but are cheaper. 
Normally, they can only be inited from an AMI image, not EBS volume, resetting any changes made along the way.
This script enables you to continue with your Spot instance where you left off.

# Running

1) Get the scripts onto your "management workstation" (e.g. your computer or a throw-away On Demand t2.micro instance).


```
git clone https://github.com/slavivanov/ec2-spotter.git
cd ec2-spotter
```

2) Create `.aws.creds` with your actual IAM credentials with EC2 privileges in this format:
Note: If you use the aws cli you already have this file created, so skip this step and supply the file in step 5.

```
AWSAccessKeyId=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWSSecretKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

3) Create a bootable EBS volume (or grab one from a stopped On Demand instance that you want to replace with a Spot Instance) and give it a unique Name (you can change the Name under the main 'Volumes' tab in the AWS Console or under Tags).

4) Edit the `example.conf` file:
- change the Volume Name to the value assigned in Step 3 (ec2spotter_volume_name)
- set your desired launch zone. I use whichever is cheaper at the moment. (ec2spotter_launch_zone)
- Set the name of the key that you use (ec2spotter_key_name)
- You might want to adjust the ec2spotter_bid_price


5) Launch the spot instance: 

```
./ec2spotter-launch example.conf .aws.creds
```

6) If you were using a throw-away On Demand instance as suggested in Step 1 to run the scripts, you may terminate or stop it now. It's no longer needed unless you want to maintain it as a central place for configuration.

# How does it work?

The launch script employs user-data to create a boot-time script that attaches the 
specified EBS volume to `/dev/xvdf` and then proceeds to do a `pivot_root` and `chroot` in order to use  it as 
the main system disk in place of `/dev/xvda`. When the instance is first created or restarted following an interruption,
the `/sbin/init` on the AMI-based EBS volume (`/dev/xvda1`) is replaced with a small shell script which performs the magic `pivot_root` and `chroot` and then chain-loads the `/sbin/init` from the specified persistent EBS volume (`/dev/xvdf1`). 
An extra reboot is performed when the instance first comes up, to ensure a clean slate. 
The end-result is a full Linux system running on the persistent volume `dev/xvdf` mounted as `/`.
The ephemeral disk remains mounted under `/old-root` and can be unmounted if needed.

# Caveats

The instance boots using the kernel and initrd from `/dev/xvda1`, which is supplied by the AMI. Nothing is done
to ensure compatibility with the system that's present on the persistent EBS volume. You need to make sure they
are compatible, if not identical.  The AMI ID supplied in the example.conf is Ubuntu 16.04 HVM 64-bit, and should
be changed to an AMI that has the same Kernel version as your target EBS system volume. This hasn't 
been tested with any other AMIs.
